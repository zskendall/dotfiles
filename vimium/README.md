# Vimium themes

Themes for styling Vimium link hints.

These themes match other system (e.g., i3, polybar, rofi, etc.) themes, and are
designed to work well with the Chrome #enable-force-dark flag. Based on
[vimium-arc-dark by
nerdius](https://gist.github.com/nerdius/63d99e826a63689d6182130bae299eb0).

To apply to Vimium:
1. Copy the CSS
2. Open Vimium options: chrome://extensions > Vimium > Details > Extension Options
3. Show Advanced Options > CSS for Vimium UI
4. Paste CSS into textarea
5. Save Changes
6. Open new or reload existing site(s)
