# Compositor (deprecated directory name)
Cloned [tryone144's compton](https://github.com/tryone144/compton) to add
kawase blur and followed the build instructions in the repo README.

Configure and start compositor (for some reason `-b` was making all windows
transparent):
```
stow compton
compton &
```
